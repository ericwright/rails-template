OVERVIEW

The template will create a new Rails app and then: 
- add authlogic and create working User and UserSession models, controllers, and views
- install haml and sass
- remove junk like public/index.html
- add jquery
- add reset.css
- create and run a script/mkdb script that will reload the db with sample data
- create a new git repo and add everything to it

CAVEATS

This Rails template assumes you'll be creating the new rails project next to this template directory.  A bad assumption, I know -- I'll fix it as soon as I know how to reference the location of the template as a variable (the way you can get the rails path with @root).  

INSTALLING

Put this template dir in the same location you want the new rails app.  If it started as an empty dir, template/ will be the only thing in there, like this:

$ ls
template

Run the rails command and pass in the main template:

$ rails foo -m template/main.template.rb

This will prompt once for your password (when you run sudo rake gems:install), but other than that it's all automated.
